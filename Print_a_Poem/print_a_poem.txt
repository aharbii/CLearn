           after she died. But if she did, I knew\n\
           it would be as a lady in a long white dress.\n\
           It is strange that she has returned\n\
           as somebody's dalmatian. I meet\n\
           the man walking her on a leash\n\
           almost every week. He says good morning\n\
           and I stoop down to calm her. He said\n\
           once that she was never like that with\n\
           other people. Sometimes she is tethered\n\
           on their lawn when I go by. If nobody\n\
           is around, I sit on the grass. When she\n\
           finally quiets, she puts her head in my lap\n\
           and we watch each other's eyes as I whisper\n\
           in her soft ears. She cares nothing about\n\
           the mystery. She likes it best when\n\
           I touch her head and tell her small\n\
           things about my days and our friends.\n\
           That makes her happy the way it always did.\n");
