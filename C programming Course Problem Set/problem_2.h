 * Description : Write a C program which reads two numbers “base”
 *               and “expo” , and calculate the power of base to
 *               the expo and print the result.
 *               
 *               - Note that: 
 *       power(base,expo) = base * base * base .... base expo times.
 * 
 *               - Sample Input : base = 5 , expo = 2
 *               - Sample Output: Power(base,expo) = 25
 * 
 *               - Note: Do this task in two different ways (The 
 *                 first way is with the pow function predefined in 
 *                 the math.h header file , and the second way is by
 *                 creating your own power function).
